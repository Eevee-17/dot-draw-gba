# Dot Draw on the Gameboy Advance

**Note: the binary does not work well with some emulators, but it does work on real hardware.**

Assembled with [Goldroad 1.7](https://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=192): `goldroad.exe dotdraw.asm`

### Controls:
- D-Pad: move the dot
- A: erase
- B: clear screen

I'm sure there are ways this can be optimized more, but I'm proud of where it is for now.
